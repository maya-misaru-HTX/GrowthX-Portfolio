# Portfolio Updates - GrowthX Design Match

## What Changed

Your portfolio has been updated to match GrowthX's design aesthetic and include the features you requested!

### âœ… New Sticky Navigation Header

A clean, professional navigation bar that stays at the top as you scroll:
- **Why GrowthX?** - Direct link to alignment section
- **Customer Health** - Links to CX systems work
- **Data & Forecasting** - Links to analytics work
- **Enablement** - Links to training programs
- **Work Sample** - Links to featured project

The header matches the style from GrowthX's website with simple, clean text links.

### âœ… About Section with Headshot

Added a professional "About" section at the top featuring:
- Your headshot in a circular frame (you need to add the photo - see instructions below)
- 7 years of experience highlight
- Global experience summary (8+ locations)
- Certifications (Notion Admin, Salesforce Admin)
- Prominent LinkedIn and Work Samples buttons

### âœ… Bright GrowthX Yellow Colors

Updated all accent colors to match GrowthX's vibrant brand:
- **Badges**: Now use bright golden yellow (#FDB515) instead of pale yellow
- **Buttons**: Eye-catching yellow with hover effects and shadows
- **Highlight boxes**: Warm yellow backgrounds for impact sections
- **CTA sections**: Bold yellow buttons that stand out

The yellow is the same bright, energetic color used in GrowthX's "Reserve your spot" button!

### âœ… Updated Section IDs

All navigation links work with smooth scrolling:
- `#why-growthx`
- `#customer-health`
- `#data-forecasting`
- `#enablement`
- `#work-sample`
