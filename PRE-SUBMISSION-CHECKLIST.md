## Portfolio Strengths to Highlight in Application

When submitting, emphasize:

1. **Operational Thinking**: "Built systems from 0 to 1, like the CX intake tracker that reduced scope creep and improved delivery timelines"

2. **Data-Driven**: "Created analytics dashboards that drove 27% profit growth and 50% reduction in meeting hours"

3. **Enablement Focus**: "Designed and facilitated AI enablement workshops for cross-functional teams"

4. **Scalable Systems**: "Implemented project review processes that standardized go/no-go decisions across 50+ projects"

## Before You Deploy - One More Thing

Make sure you're comfortable explaining any part of your portfolio in an interview. Recruiters and hiring managers may ask:
- "Tell me about the CX intake tracker you built"
- "How did you achieve a 27% profit increase?"
- "Walk me through your approach to the Project Review Implementation"

Review your work samples PDF and be ready to elaborate!
