# Adding Your Headshot - Step by Step

Your portfolio is already configured to show your headshot in the circular frame.
You just need to save your cherry blossom photo to the right location!

## METHOD 1: Using Finder (Easiest)

1. Save the cherry blossom photo from this chat to your Desktop
   (Right-click the image → Save Image As → Save to Desktop)

2. Open Finder and navigate to:
   Desktop/growthx-portfolio/public

3. Drag your saved photo into the 'public' folder

4. Rename it to: headshot.jpg
   (Make sure it's exactly: headshot.jpg, not headshot.JPG or headshot.jpeg)

5. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:5173/
   Your photo should now appear in the circular frame!

## METHOD 2: Using Terminal

If you saved the photo to your Desktop as "cherry-blossom.jpg":

cd ~/Desktop/growthx-portfolio/public
cp ~/Desktop/cherry-blossom.jpg headshot.jpg

Then refresh your browser!

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure the file is named exactly: headshot.jpg (lowercase)
- The file should be in: ~/Desktop/growthx-portfolio/public/
- Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
- After adding, refresh your browser (Command + R)

## Can't see the image folder?

The 'public' folder is at:
/Users/misakifunada/Desktop/growthx-portfolio/public

Once you add headshot.jpg there, it will automatically appear in the circle!
